    Hi! This is Krushna. I am learning to build cool things using web developement.

    I have worked on some CLI apps that I will publish here tomorrow.

    My favourite book is 'The alchmist'. I like this book because it gives an overview of why we do things in our everyday life. It depicts that everything that happens around us has some definite purpose and meaning.
