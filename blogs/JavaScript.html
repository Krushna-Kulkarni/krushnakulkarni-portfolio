            <h4>What is JavaScript?</h4>
                <p>JavaScript is a computer programming language that has been slowly growing in popularity over the last few years. It's designed to simplify coding for developers, so they can focus on the functionality of their site or app instead of having to create it from scratch. The language is often associated with small bits of code meant to be placed on a webpage, although it's also capable of being used as a standalone program.</p>
                <p>Although it's based off of Java, the language is significantly different. However, it does share some similarities with the original programming language. JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 at Netscape Communications Corporation (now owned by AOL).</p>
                <h4>What is JavaScript Used For?</h4>
                <p>JavaScript is commonly used to either enhance the functionality of a website or create entire new experiences within an app. It can be used for basic purposes such as validating forms, adding functionality to web apps, handling clicks on specific elements on a page or even redirecting viewers to another page. It can also be used for more complicated functions such as running animations and building programmatic games.</p>
                <p>There are a variety of ways JavaScript can be used on a page as it can be embedded as a web component, as an applet, as part of the head section on the page or even embedded in the body of a webpage. Commonly, JavaScript is manipulated through the use of tags which allow developers to execute code without having to insert it into a webpage directly.</p>
                <h4>How is JavaScript Used?</h4>
                <p>JavaScript is commonly integrated into web pages not only through its use as a programming language but also by using it as part of an HTML tag where browser-based interactivity is built. It's often placed in the &lt;script&gt; tag, although other tags may be used such as &lt;img&gt; or &lt;object&gt;. For example, an image could be created with the help of JavaScript through the use of code placed within an <img> tag. JavaScript can even be placed in CSS files or HTML files, which is why it's often referred to as a complementary language.</p>
                <h4>What Types of Code are Used in JavaScript?</h4>
                <p>JavaScript uses specific syntax that acts as instructions for the web browser. When interpreting this code, the browser performs the action stated by the command only if it meets all of its requirements prior to activation. For instance, there are conditional statements that require a certain condition to be met before executing any of its instructions. On the other hand, there are functions that execute their commands regardless of what may or may not be true on a page.</p>
