                <p>Throughout history, many great works of literature have been written in order to examine the human condition, but few in recent memory have made the kind of global impact that The Alchemist has.</p>
                    <p> Written by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist is a universally acclaimed work of fiction that revolves around an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who starts his quest for enlightenment when he encounters the Egyptian alchemist. What’s so compelling about this novel are its themes on self-discovery and personal growth.</p>
                <p>When we think of our hopes and dreams, we cannot help but feel inspired. We all have goals and aspirations, but few of us take the time to do something about it. That is what makes the story so powerful – the way it captures human nature by mirroring our dreams and desires.</p>
                
                <p>The Alchemist tells the story of Santiago, who travels from Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in a hidden pyramids. Along his journey, he encounters many difficulties that tests his determination and will to see this journey to its end: betrayal, false friendship and love, spirits who guide him along his way and even death itself.</p>
                <p>The Alchemist is a book about self-discovery, and although it has been published in many languages such as English, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese; it is one of the most remarkable books in the history of mankind.</p>
                <p>A great novel is much more than mere entertainment: It can be viewed as a living breathing culture that embodies values and ideals that people hold dear. Combine this with its profound meaning and timeless theme and you have The Alchemist.</p>
